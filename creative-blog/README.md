# Richard Sterling Jackson – A Custom Blog

A personal portfolio and technical journal built to showcase my work as a full-stack developer and machine learning enthusiast. This blog is both memoir and manifesto — a modular, privacy-conscious space for storytelling, engineering, and reflection.

## Features

- Dynamic Category System  
  Curated themes like Plans in Motion, Words and Charms, and Tools and Systems — synced across Sidebar, Admin, and Category views.

  Create, edit, and manage posts with versioning, featured flags, and category tagging.

- Post Routing  
  Clean URLs for posts (`/posts/:slug`) and categories (`/category/:slug`) using React Router.

- Modular Architecture  
  Components, pages, and styles organized for clarity and scalability.

- Typography & Styling  
  Elegant fonts (Playfair + Inter), soft UI, and emotionally resonant layout.

- Privacy-Conscious Design  
  No exposed emails, no broken links — every detail is intentional.
