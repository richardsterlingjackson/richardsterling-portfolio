# 🚀 Richard Sterling Jackson | Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

Building modular, responsive web applications with clarity, precision, and purpose.

Welcome to my public portfolio repository. This space showcases my journey into full-stack development, with projects that reflect technical depth, personal storytelling, and cross-domain versatility. Each folder contains a standalone application built with modern frameworks and clean architecture.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Full-stack developer with a background in engineering and science, now building scalable web applications, training machine learning models, and ensuring software quality through robust testing practices. I specialize in front-end frameworks like Angular and React, back-end development with Node.js and Python, and have hands-on experience in machine learning workflows and SQA methodologies. I value clarity, adaptability, and thoughtful design—both in code and in presentation.

## 🧠 Core Skills

- **Front-End**: Angular, React, Vite, Tailwind, SCSS
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express, Python, REST APIs
- **Full-Stack**: GitHub workflows, modular architecture, deployment pipelines
- **Machine Learning**: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, model evaluation
- **Software Quality Assurance**: Unit testing, end-to-end testing, CI/CD integration
