## Project Overview

This project uses the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset collected from smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes. It contains time-series features extracted from motion signals, labeled with six distinct activities such as walking, sitting, and laying. The goal is to train a classifier that can accurately predict the activity based on sensor input.

## Sample Output

```
Accuracy: 0.96
Precision: 0.95
Recall: 0.94
F1 Score: 0.95
```

A confusion matrix will be displayed to visualize classification performance

## What it Does

1. 	Load and preprocess the dataset
2. 	Split into training and testing sets
3. 	Train a RandomFOrestClassifier
4. 	Predict and evaluate using:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 Score
5. 	Visualize the confusion matrix with Seaborn

## Why This Project?

This project explores how physical movement that is captured as raw sensor data can be translated into structured and interpretable insights. It reflects my interest in mapping environmental and behavioral signals into meaningful decision tools. By modeling human activity, Iâ€™m bridging the gap between embodied experience and algorithmic understanding.
