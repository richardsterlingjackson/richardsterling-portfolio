# Spam Email Classifier â€” Logistic Regression on Spambase

A machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or not spam using logistic regression. Built with scikit-learn and visualized with Seaborn, this project demonstrates end-to-end model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## Project Overview

This project uses the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (via Kaggle), which contains 57 numerical features extracted from email content. The goal is to train a binary classifier that predicts whether an email is spam.

## Dataset

**Source**: Spambase Dataset on Kaggle
**Features**: 57 continuous variables (e.g., frequency of specific words characters, capital letter usage)
**Target**: 1 for spam, 0 for non-spam

## How to Run

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Run the program:
```bash
python spam_filter.py
```

## Sample Output

```
Accuracy: 0.94
Precision: 0.92
Recall: 0.90
F1 Score: 0.91
```

A confusion matrix will be displayed to visualize classification performance

## What it Does

1. 	Load and preprocess the dataset
2. 	Split into training and testing sets
3. 	Train a LogisticRegression model
4. 	Predict and evaluate using:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 Score
5. 	Visualize the confusion matrix with Seaborn

## Why This Project?

This project explores how structured data can reveal patterns in digital communicationâ€”an exercise in translating behavioral signals into interpretable, actionable insights. It reflects my interest in mapping emotional and environmental signals into meaningful design and decision-making tools.
